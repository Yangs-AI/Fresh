## What is Fresh?

**Fresh** is an open and evolving library designed for researchers.  
It provides reusable components for every part of academic writing, from data visualization code, tables and algorithm pseudocode in LaTeX format, to `.bib` references, writing assets, and research utilities.

Each entry in Fresh is:

- *Plug-and-Play*: directly usable or easily adaptable
- *Reproducible*: accompanied by minimal working examples
- *Traceable*: linked to sources and references
- *Friendly*: designed to help researchers share knowledge efficiently

## A Fresh Beginning

Research becomes powerful when it's shared, not just as papers, but as reusable building blocks.
